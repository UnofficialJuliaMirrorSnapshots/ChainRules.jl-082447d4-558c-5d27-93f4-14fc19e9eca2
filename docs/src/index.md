# ChainRules

[ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl) provides a variety of common utilities that can be used by downstream automatic differentiation (AD) tools to define and execute forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode primitives.

This package is a work-in-progress, as is the documentation. Contributions welcome!
